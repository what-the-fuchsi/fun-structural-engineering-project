# Hello Recruiters
I implemented this small project during my preparations for a university exam. At the time it helped me understand concepts of the lecture and for me it was just a fun way of combining exam preparations with some programming exercise. Also I guess it showcases some of my object oriented modelling capabilities (which have improved since then!). It's not very useful as a tool tbh, but the main.py should run as it is.
