# Hello Recruiters
I implemented this small project during my preparations for a university exam. It's not very useful as a tool, and the code is probably also not the best tbh, but the main.py should run as it is. 

At the time it helped me understand concepts of the lecture and for me it was just a fun way of combining exam preparations with some programming exercise. Also I guess it showcases some of my object oriented modelling capabilities (which have improved since then!).
